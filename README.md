# Unofficial Google Colaboratory Notebook and Repository Gallery

**Please contact me to take over and revamp this repo (it gets around 30k views and 200k clicks per year), I don't have time to update or maintain it - message 15/03/2021**

A curated list of repositories with fully functional click-and-run colab notebooks with data, code and description. The code in these repositories are in Python unless otherwise stated. 

To learn more about they whys and hows of Colab [see this post](https://medium.com/@firmai/google-colab-for-reproducible-research-webapps-and-data-science-fb1beec30304). For a few tips and tricks see [this post](https://www.google-colab.com/google-colab-tips-and-tricks/). 

**If you have just a single notebook to submit, use the website https://google-colab.com/, it is really easy, on the top right corner click 'submit +'. The earlier you post the more visibility you will get over time**

***Caution:*** This is a work in progress, please contribute by adding colab functionality to your own data science projects on github or requestion it from the authors.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@dereknow](https://twitter.com/dereknow) or on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snowderek/).
Also, a listed repository should be fixed or removed:

* if there are no data or descriptive text in the notebooks.
* the code throws out errors.

Apart from the colab-enabled repositories listed below, you can also with a bit of work run github jupyter notebooks directly on Google Colaboratory using CPU/GPU/TPU runtimes by replacing https://github.com in the URL by https://colab.research.google.com/github/. No local installation of Python is required. Of course, these notebooks would have to be adapted to ingest the necessary data and modules.
